I am going to simulate: Waterloo, Euston, King's Cross, Paddington and Victoria for my app.

These are some of the events that the simulation could handle. Arrival, departure, delays and passenger queues. 

For Stations
- Which trains are currently there
- What time do train leave/arrive

For trains
- Unique Names/IDs
- Schedule between stations
- A system that simulates a train departures and arrivals 

Extra things
The app currently works on the terminal, once the basics are done, I would create an interface for the app.

Buttons 
- One for displaying arrivals 
- One for displaying departures
