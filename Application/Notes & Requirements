I am going to simulate: Waterloo, Euston, King's Cross, Paddington, Victoria, Baker Street, Oxford Circus, and Tottenham Court Road for my app.

These are some of the events that the simulation could handle. Arrival, departure, delays and passenger queues. 

For Stations
- Which trains are currently there
- What time do train leave/arrive
- Information about a train: stops, route and how long it takes to arrive in other stations

For trains
- Unique Names
- Unique IDs
- A route
- A schedule between stations
- A system that simulates a train departures and arrivals 

Buttons 
- One for displaying arrivals 
- One for displaying departures
