When the app is lunched, the user would see the app title.

In Menu 3 Options
"1. View departures"
"2. View arrivals"
"3. View clock"

Now the user can type a number.
if 1 is chosen, new options would display.

"Select station:"
1. Waterloo
2. Euston

Again the user can pick an option.

Example: User selects 1.
Example of future output, once I finalise the system: "T-101 leaves at 08:00. Arrives at Euston Station at 08:45."

The same concept would be utilised for the arrivals options.
Once clicked the output would be something like this.
Example: "T-101 — from Waterloo Station — arrived at 08:45".

Finally I would create an exit option.

THIS IS THE CODE THAT I MADE AS A STARTER FOR THE FINAL APP 
import time

#App title
print("--- Train App ---")

#Exiting the app
def Exit_event():
    print("Bye")

#Showing Departures of Waterloo
def Waterloo_time_show():
    print("*Showing leaving trains and time*")
    print()
    Home()

def Euston_time_show():
    print("*Showing leaving trains and time*")
    print()
    Home()

#For when the user picks the option for "Departures"
def Departure_scene():
    print()
    print("1. Waterloo")
    print("2. Euston")
    user_selecting_station = float(input("Select station: "))
    if user_selecting_station ==1:
        Waterloo_time_show()
    elif user_selecting_station ==2:
        Euston_time_show()

#Home options
def Home():
    print("1. View departures")
    print("2. View arrivals")
    print("3. View clock")
    print("4. Exit App")
    user_selecting_menu = float(input("Choose an option: "))
    if user_selecting_menu ==1:
        Departure_scene()
    elif user_selecting_menu ==2:
        print("Arrival system would show all the arrivals")
        print()
        Home()
    elif user_selecting_menu ==3:
        print("The current time would be displayed here")
        print()
        Home()
    elif user_selecting_menu ==4:
        Exit_event()

    else:
        print("Invalid Number")
        print()
        Home()
Home()
