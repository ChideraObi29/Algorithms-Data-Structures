When the app is lunched, the user would see the app title.

In Menu 3 Options
"1. View departures"
"2. View arrivals"
"3. View clock"

Now the user can type a number.
if 1 is chosen, new options would display.

"Select station:"
1. Waterloo
2. Euston

Again the user can pick an option.

Example: User selects 1.
Example of future output, once I finalise the system: "T-101 leaves at 08:00. Arrives at Euston Station at 08:45."

The same concept would be utilised for the arrivals options.
Once clicked the output would be something like this.
Example: "T-101 — from Waterloo Station — arrived at 08:45".
