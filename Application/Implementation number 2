I have created a code that displays the current date and time on a seperate python file and then added the code on
the main app file.

#Displaying date and time
import datetime

current_time=datetime.datetime.now()
print(current_time)

However, this prints the date as well so I rewrote the code so that it only prints he time.

import time
print(time.strftime("%H:%M:%S"))

Now I have created I basic schedule system using AI on a different python file.  The target time can be used to display the arrivals of trains.

import time
from datetime import datetime

TARGET_TIME = "16:27"   #Schedule example

while True:
    now = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M")

    if now == TARGET_TIME:
        print("Prints arrivals of trains")
        time.sleep(60)   

    time.sleep(1)
